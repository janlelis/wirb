== Wavy Interactive Ruby
*Wirb* colorizes your inspected Ruby objects. It is based on Wirble[http://pablotron.org/software/wirble/], but only provides and improves result highlighting.

http://travis-ci.org/janlelis/wirb.png

== Install
Install the gem with:

  gem install wirb

== Usage
Add to your <tt>~/.irbrc</tt>

  require 'rubygems' unless defined? Gem
  require 'wirb'
  Wirb.start

== Features
* Syntax highlighting for Ruby objects
* Does not change the inspect value
* Support for generic objects, especially sets and enumerators
* Comes with tests
* Can be used without irb
* Limited stdlib/gem objects support (e.g. Set, Gem::Requirement)
* Supports 1.8, 1.9, jruby, rbx, head

== Customize
The color schema can be changed with:

  Wirb.schema = { :comma => :purple, ... }

Wirb color schemas are (almost) compatible with those from the original Wirble, but there are lots of extensions. Take a look at wirb/schema.rb or <tt>Wirb.schema</tt> for a list of available token descriptions. See wirb/colors.rb or <tt>Wirb::Colors</tt> for the available colors and how to create your own.  Wirb uses rainbow[https://github.com/sickill/rainbow] for color and supports 256-color terminals.

For support on Windows, you should install the following gems:

  gem install windows-pr win32console

Color schemas wanted! You've got a good looking alternative color schema? Please post it on the wiki[https://github.com/janlelis/wirb/wiki/schemas], it may be bundled with a next version ;)

== wp
You can colorize any object with <tt>wp</tt> (wavy_print):
  require 'wirb/wp'
  wp some_object
  wp some_object, :light_red
